# pdp-project-mongo

- Project for Prismates to easily setup a Mongo project on PDP
- `.env` is intentionally committed
- This project is setup following this guide: https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/mongodb-typescript-mongodb
- Please do not modify this repo as it should be a base starter for all Prismates, and designed for quick import in PDP control plane. Thanks!
